        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Tina and I am currently double majoring in Business Management and Sustainability Studies at University of California, Riverside. During my senior year of high school, I received the opportunity to take an AP Environmental Sciences class, and later on, I realized how passionate I was about sustainability and knew that this was my calling, hence the reason why I applied to UCR as a Sustainability Studies major. Throughout my first year of college, I gained a lot more insight on sustainability and the role of businesses and corporations on anthropogenic climate change. There is no doubt that large businesses and corporations are primarily responsible for the rapid warming of our planet, and I aspire to do my part by double majoring in Sustainability and Business Management. 
<br><br>

        In January of 2021, I decided to take a lash training course in order to become certified to do eyelash extensions, and I can confidently say that this is my calling. The best part about being a lash artist is that it doesn’t even feel like a job to me. I love what I do, and I find comfort in the fact that this job allows me to build a greater sense of confidence in my clients. After rethinking my future plans for some time, I have decided that I am going to go to beauty school after I graduate in order to become a licensed esthetician. From there onwards, I am going to keep working from home until I save up enough money to open up my own lash salon and continue doing what I love. After gaining enough experience, I hope to be able to create a space in my salon where I can train new lash students and guide them through the lash industry. One of my other goals in life is to purchase a popular boba franchise, like The Alley, 7Leaves, or Tastea, and become the owner of a thriving boba business. I plan on taking this huge step in my life when I am able to save up enough money through my lash business. I know that I won’t be able to lash clients confidently as I fall victim to aging, so owning a boba business would be a great alternative. With my Business Management and Sustainability Studies degrees, I plan on promoting sustainable practices within my businesses in hopes of encouraging my competitors to do the same as well. It’s the 21st century, we have to pursue our dreams while protecting our planet at the same time.
<br><br>

        As I grow older, I’ve come to a realization that I cannot see myself working for anyone in the future. I’ve always had this tendency to lead people, which is why I aspire to be my own boss and work under my own rules. I want to become a successful girl boss and hopefully be able to inspire other women to fight the patriarchy and live to their fullest potential.
